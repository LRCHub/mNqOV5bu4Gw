We're on the way back in the moment now
We're on the way back in the moment now

I stare into space, I'm in your mind now
I did grieve you, you somehow
I stare into you, will you bear more pain?
I know your thoughts drive me insane

I close my eyes alone in my room
There is no silence in my head
I try to see the truth, the way I loose

We're on the way back in the moment now
We're on the way back in the moment now

"Ich seh' in Deinem Herz
Deine Gedanken
Ein Blick in Deine Welt
Ich fìhl' Deinen Schmerz.
Die Zeit ist verloren
Der Augenblick
Der unsere Tr¤ume erh¤lt

I close my eyes alone in my room
There is no silence in my head
I try to see the truth, the way I loose

I close my eyes alone in my room
There is no silence in my head
I try to see the truth, the way I loose

We're on the way back in the moment now
We're on the way back in the moment now

I close my eyes alone in my room
There is no silence in my head
I try to see the truth, the way I loose
